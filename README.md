Exercise 1 | Home Library
Design a relational database to manage information about the books that you have in your collection. 

You should have as much information as possible about your books - not just an author, title, description, chapters etc., but also information such as when you bought a book, start/end reading date etc. Try to be as detailed as possible.


You should document your design processes (4 steps from the pre-work material) in PDF documents. 

At the end of the day, all students should present their solutions. 

You should create documentation for all todayâ€™s exercises.
